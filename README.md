# Smash


This is a built from scratch version of a shell terminal completed for CS253 in the Fall of 2019. This terminal supports external commands and the 'history' command as defined by the project specifications. The Smash terminal as I've uploaded does not support redirects or pipes. The makefile supports four different file configuration options: all, clean, valgrind, and debug (for GDB).
